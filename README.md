# SortingAlgorithmsComparison

simple library that implements different sorting algorithms and a basic main to showcase the difference in complexity tghrough execution time.

the objextive of this project is to implement a way to visualize the way different sorting algorithms work and how complexity affects execution time using openGL (not implemented yet).
